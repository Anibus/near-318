### B. Inspiration

- Ideally, the lottery must be clear and transparent.
- We bring the Bingo 18 version on the chain.
- Simplify everything and increase the chance get the reward.
- High probability with the combination of 3 numbers of 1-digit one.

### C. What it does

- Players will participate in the spins by choosing their desired number on the screen.
- The results will be generated randomly from "Smart Contract" on Blockchain (NEAR Network)
- Each round will take place within 10 minutes.
- There are 38 different winning and playing modes for players.
- At the end of the game session, the results will be notified and compared.
- Prizes are received almost immediately in the participant's wallet.
- The prize will create each round to share at last among winners.

### D. How we built it

- ReactJS (NextJS Framework)
- Near SDK, API JS, Link: https://docs.near.org/tools/near-sdk-js
- Near Wallet
- Bootstrap with CSS
- Support Responsiveness on Mobile.
- Vercel Hosting for dApp Static Site.
- Mob-X, Redux for State Management.

### E. Challenges we ran into

- The documentation of Smart Contract in JS SDK is quite new, seem lack of material for developers.
- Recognized the limitation of the network for our next idea to reduce rounding time to less than 10 minutes.
- How it could be supported worldwide for massive users using in the future.

### F. Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We are proud to finished creating an innovative dApp LOT on the chain.
- The MVP doesn't get plenty of time, to make it perfect, but it works.

- And also how to deploy the Contract on NEAR Network.
